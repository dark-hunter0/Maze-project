This project consists of two parts: An maze generator and an automatic Maze solver. 


Folder _Mazes_ contains 5 mazes generated with this method.

There are Four ways that you can choose from the to solve the maze for comparison.
* `dfs` uses DFS (Depth First Search) to solve the maze blindly. It's inefficient (most of the times runs through the whole maze to find the solution).
* `bfs` uses DFS (Breadth First Search) to solve the maze blindly. It's inefficient (most of the times runs through the whole maze to find the solution).
* `a_star` uses A* algorithm (its an informed algorithm that takes decissions based on a cost funtion).

* `genetic_algorithm` uses GA algorithm (t generates a population of possible solutions and evolves them over time based on fitness, crossover, and mutation.).
